# alomgit

Once upon a time, our brave soldier Alomgir ran into the enemy team as an individual. As he entered the enemy team's territory he realised the unfortunate situation that was upon him and his heart sank along with his HP, as all 5 of the enemy team clawed at him, ending his reign on Azir. He was the last to go down after his fallen teammates. 

However, the enemy team were merciful enough to let him have his final words. Within his last moments, expending all remaining energy in his dying body, he has flashbacks to what his teammates have done for him, Abdullah and Haseeb both had his back in the past on several occasions. With this in mind, he shouts "FUCK PAKISTAN!"
